Indefinite integral,https://i.ibb.co/d7BmMVG/indefinite-integral.png,"In calculus, an antiderivative, inverse derivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integral of a function f is a differentiable function F whose derivative is equal to the original function f. This can be stated symbolically as F' = f. The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative. Antiderivatives are often denoted by capital Roman letters such as F and G. Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the second fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function over a closed interval where the function is Riemann integrable is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval. In physics, antiderivatives arise in the context of rectilinear motion (e.g., in explaining the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration). The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative,indef-int,"[{""key"":""expression"",""placeholder"":""Expression""}]"
Definite integral,https://i.ibb.co/gPCqmZK/definite-integral.jpg,"In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operations of calculus, the other being differentiation. Integration was initially used to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. Usage of integration expanded to a wide variety of scientific fields thereafter. A definite integral computes the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function; in this case, they are also called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integration to differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known; differentiation and integration are inverse operations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral,def-int,"[{""key"":""expression"",""placeholder"":""Expression""},{""key"":""lowerLimit"",""placeholder"":""Lower limit""},{""key"":""upperLimit"",""placeholder"":""Upper limit""},{""key"":""isDecimal"",""placeholder"":""Is decimal"",""type"":""checkbox""}]"
